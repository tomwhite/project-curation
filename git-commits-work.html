    <h1>My Professional Open Source Projects</h1>
    <p>
      This plot shows the main open-source projects that I have worked on professionally over my career via a visualization of git commits.
      Each dot on the chart shows a week where I contributed in some way to the project code - typically a commit of
      some code I wrote, or (for the Hadoop projects) reviewing and committing someone else's code.
    <p>
    <p>
      I have contributed to many more projects than the ones shown here, but all of these here are ones
      to which I made sustained contributions, usually over multiple years.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this data, three main phases are apparent.
    </p>
    <h3>Hadoop</h3>
    <p>
      From 2006 to 2015 I worked exclusively on <a href="https://github.com/apache/hadoop">Apache Hadoop</a> and projects in the Hadoop eco-system
      (mainly <a href="https://github.com/apache/avro">Avro</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apache/parquet-java">Parquet</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/apache/crunch">Crunch</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kite-sdk/kite">Kite</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/apache/whirr">Whirr</a>).
      (It's not shown here, but I also wrote four editions of a <a href="http://www.hadoopbook.com/">book on Hadoop</a> from 2008 to 2012.)
    </p>

    <h3>Hadoop and Genomics</h3>
    <p>
      In 2015 I joined the data science team at Cloudera and shifted my focus to applications running on Hadoop and Spark,
      and contributed mainly to <a href="https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk">GATK</a> and related projects
      (<a href="https://github.com/HadoopGenomics/Hadoop-BAM">Hadoop-BAM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/samtools/htsjdk">htsjdk</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/disq-bio/disq">Disq</a>). I left Cloudera in 2018, but continued
      working on these projects through to the end of 2019.
    </p>

    <h3>Python and Genomics</h3>
    <p>
      In 2020 I pivoted to the PyData community, and started working on <a href="https://github.com/sgkit-dev/sgkit">sgkit</a>,
      and later <a href="https://github.com/sgkit-dev/bio2zarr">bio2zarr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sgkit-dev/vcztools">vcztools</a>.
      I also developed the more general <a href="https://github.com/cubed-dev/cubed">Cubed</a> processing engine in tandem with these projects.
